      <h3>DO YOU KNOW YOUR BODY TYPE?</h3>
      <p>
        According to Ayurveda, there are three main metabolic body types (physiologies),
        that form the basic framework of a person.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are the essential forces behind an individual‚Äôs physical, mental, and emotional makeup.
        It is imperative to map your needs to your dosha type to get the best results.
        There are three basic doshas every individual inherits either a combination or any one of these doshas.
